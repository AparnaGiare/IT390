Prescription Tracker 

Never forget to refill your prescription anymore!

The Prescription Tracker will track all your prescriptions and send you reminders for taking medicine, keeping track of your pills left till next refill, how many refills you have left, reminder to contact your doctor if you have 0 refills and need doctors authorization etc.

Users will be able to add their medications to the app by designating names, dosages and schedules. Reminders will be generated based upon each medication's schedule. As a user takes their medications they can mark them as taken or skipped. For medications not marked as taken or skipped, reminders will trigger. Reminders will be both on-screen and can be configured to push out to the user via SMS and/or email. On-screen reminders will pop-up, allowing the user to mark them as taken, missed, skipped. The user can even "snooze" a pop-up reminder.
